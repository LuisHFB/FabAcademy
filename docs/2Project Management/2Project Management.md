# 2. Project Management

## Assignment

* Build a personal site describing you and your final project.
* Work through a git tutorial.

##What's Git and GitHub? How can I use them with mkdocs?:anguished:

And finally what is Markdown? :eyes: :eyes:

I had a difficult time understanding the purpose of each one (Git, GitHub, mkdocs and markdown) and how to use them together to create a site.
Fortunately, in my work team, we were talking about interesting courses on Alura platform that we could take to improve our skills, and Git/GitHub course was one of them. I didn't conclude it, but it gave me a good knowledge about how Git and GitHub run.

### Research

* [**Git**](https://blog.betrybe.com/tecnologia/git-e-github/) is an open-source version control system, in other words, free of charge. It is used for creating a change history in the source code of software' development projects. It was designed by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system.

* [**Github**](https://blog.betrybe.com/tecnologia/git-e-github/) is a remote repository created as an online Git repository hosting service.

* [**MkDocs**](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

* [**Markdown**](https://blog.bit.ai/what-is-markdown/) was created back in 2004 by John Gruber (of Daring Fireball) as an easy way for non-coders to write in a format that could be easily converted into HTML. John Gruber defines Markdown as, “A text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)“.

### Creating a personal site: **For Windows**

1. Install [Python 3.8.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/);
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on Windows and let the Git Bash terminal be started;
3. In Git Bash terminal, type "py --version" to see if the process worked out.

4. For downloading libraries from Git repositories, it's necessary the package manager of python, PIP. Type "pip --version" to see if it has already been installed.

5. For starting the website follow [Getting Started](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/) page of MkDocs. It'll create all the basics files of the site on the local computer and give instructions of how to make changes in each page.
6. For hosting it on GitHub follow the [Allythy tutorial](https://allythy.github.io/como-criar-documentacao-com-mkdocs) from "Deploy para o GitHub" topic until the end. It'll also generated the URL of documentation, similar of mine https://rmeliana.github.io/FabAcademy/.
