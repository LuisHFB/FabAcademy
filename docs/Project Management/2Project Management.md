# 2. Project Management

##Assignment

* Build a personal site describing you and your final project.
* Work through a git tutorial.

##What's Git and GitHub? How can I use them with mkdocs?:anguished:

And finally what is Markdown? :eyes: :eyes:
I had a difficult time understanding the purpose of each one (Git, GitHub, mkdocs and markdown) and how to use them together to create a site.
Fortunately, in my work team, we were talking about interesting courses on Alura platform that we could take to improve our skills, and Git/GitHub course was one of them. I didn't conclude it, but it gave me a good knowledge about how Git and GitHub run.

###Git and GitHub
The main aims of using Git/GitHub are the version control of my documentation and having a public repository (for share the contents) with other people.
