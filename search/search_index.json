First I would like to fix some points that caused some problems during assembly like: Clocking the position of the arms correctly with the servos Redesigning some 3d printed parts to make them more sturdy Make the wire routing easier Implement a servo driver so to make motor operation smoother Add the use of batteries (need to have a BMS(battery manegement system)) Then swap the ESP8266 with an ESP32 with camera module so it would be possible to use it as a FPV Cam for the remote players. A point of interest is developing fun activities so people can play remotely, and adapting Robozito to said activities like solving puzzles or navigating some maze.

Git : An open-source version control system used for creating a history of changes in the source code of software's development project. GitHub : A remote repository hosting service workins as an online Git. Markdown : A \"text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers\" according to Jon Gruber, its creator. It is a tool that allows writing using plain text, converting it to a valid XHTML structure.. Mkdocs : A static website generator for building project documention. Its source files are written in Markdown and set in a single YAML configuration file. Installing Python, Git, Mkdocs and Materials for Mkdocs \u00b6 OS: Pop!_OS ( Linux ) Normally Linux comes with Python installed out of the box but to check it use in your terminal: python --version In case Python is not installed check this link and follow the documentation for installation steps. If it's installed you'll receive a message like the one bellow: Check if the Pip command is avaiable by typing the following: pip --version If pip is installed, the terminal will return something like the image bellow: Usually Pip is installed with Python. Now is time to install Mkdocs, using the following command in the terminal: pip install mkdocs After the installation is done, it is going to be possible to start the website building. In the Mkdocs website you can follow the first steps to prepare the documentation in your own static website. You cand find the guide in the Getting Started section. This guide will teach you how to create a new project as wel as adding pages, theming the documentation and using icons through the YAML configuration file. In my project, I used a theme called Materials for Mkdocs . Since it is a theme that does not come with Mkdocs, I needed to install it using the following line: pip install mkdocs-material With the theme installed, I just needed to set the name material on the folowwing line in the mkdocs.yml file to use it. Write the following command line in the terminal to preview the new site with the Material theme: mkdocs serve Deploying to Github and Automating the Process \u00b6 Now it is time to deploy our website to GitHub, and finally have it online on the internet. To do it I followed the Allithy Tutorial , more specifically in the \"Deploy para o Github\" section. With the tutorial, we are going to get a URL address for our documentation site. In my case the address was https://leonrosa.github.io/FabAcademy/ . Once the files are on the GitHub repository, everytime that we need to make an update we will need to repeat the deployment process. To make this step easier, I chose to automated following the Parker Erickson tutorial . Install all dependencies before update the documentation. Create the file 'requirement.txt' on the root of the documentation main folder. Inside the file, write the following lines: mkdocs>=1.1 mkdocs-material>=7.1 Pygments>=2.4 markdown>=3.2 pymdown-extensions>=7.0 mkdocs-material-extensions>=1.0 Finally, install them adding the following command in the YAML file found inside the 'my-project .github\\workflows' folder: - name: Install dependencies run: | pip install -r requirements.txt pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-plugin Code Editor and Terminal \u00b6 To build and develop my documentation website, I needed to use a code editor software. The software was needed to edit the YAML files and create the texts in Markdown . In my documentation I chose the EMACS with the Spacemacs distribution. I also needed to use the terminal to install and operate the Mkdocs server. My Linux terminal of choice is ZSH with OhMyZSH framework. Besides my choice, the steps above can also be fulfilled with other code editors like Notepad++ , Atom and Sublime and/or with other terminals like the Command Prompt from Windows operating system. References \u00b6 For more informations related with inserting images, code blocks, buttons, lists, etc. you can read the Material for Mkdocs references . But the informations in the link doesnt cover the information to add videos in the documentation. To do it I can follow two methods, one for Youtube videos and the other for videos files located in my computer. The methods are: Videos Youtube videos Go to the Video page on YouTube and click on the Share Button. Choose Embed. Copy and Paste the HTML snippet in your markdown. Example: <center> <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4gGWufoIYI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </center> Result: Local videos To add a local video in the documentation site, we can do it through a issue in GitHub. But the video will be restricted to until 10MB, what does it mean that the video need to be short to be uploaded Then copy the address video and paste into your file like the code below.

The process consists of the arrangement of successive layers to create the object and each layer can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the object. 3D Printer - Ultimaker 2+ \u00b6 The Insper Fab Lab is equipped with two models of 3D printers, the Ultimaker 2+ and a Zmorph 2.0 SX . For this group assignment we used the Ultimaker printer to test the design rules and document its limits. Here are the equipment specifications: Print technology: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) Build volume : 230 x 225 x 205mm Filament diameter: 2.85 mm Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm Print speed: 30 mm/s - 300 mm/s Supported Filaments: PLA and ABS. Overall Size: 357 x 342 x 388mm File Transfer: Standard SD card Printing Software: Cura Preparing for printing in the Cura \u00b6 To fulfill the requirements of this assignment, I used the 3D Printer Test Models created by Make Magazine . It is possible to download the files here . The test models avaiables in those files are: Dimensional Accuracy Bridging Performance Overhang Performance Negative Space Tolerance Fine Positive Features Performance XY Resonance Z Resonance I imported the files into Cura , a software developed by Ultimaker where is possible to set up the printing configurations and parameters. I set up the printing for PLA material and with the following parameters: Layer Height: 0.15mm Wall Line Count: 4 Top Layers: 6 Bottom Layers: 6 Infill Density: 15% Infill Pattern: Grid Print Speed: 45mm/s Build Plate Adhesion Type: Raft Here is a preview from Cura of the printing showing that it going to take almost 10 hours of printing. I exported a .gcode file to a SD Card and pluged in it into the printer. From the main menu I selected the \"print\" option followed by the selection of the .gcode file. The buildplate and the hotend will start to heat up until 60\u00b0C and 200\u00b0C respectively (temperatures set up for PLA material) and as soon the temperature is reached, the printing process will start. By the end of the process, I got the following result: Unfortunately, I notice that some shapes from this print did not came up as I expected. On the the dimension accuracy model and the negative space tolerance model the cylinders did not came out rounded but with an elliptical shape. This happened cause the axis and belts from the printer were not aligned and tied enough. Then I needed to adjust them and repeat the printing process. After disassembling, cleaning, aligning and assembling the printer again, I printed the testers one more time and got a better result. With that issue fixed, I could evaluate the testers that were printed. Dimensional Accuracy \u00b6 The Dimensional Accuracy test came out as expected. After fixing the alignment issue that resulted in a elliptical body, the second printed tester came out rounded as planned and with the dimensions according to the digital model. Here it is the dimensions of the digital model: Here it is the dimensions of the printed part: Bridging Performance \u00b6 The Bridging Test also presented good results. The bridges were formed in all levels, but got a better finishing with the first and second one. I would recommend brigdings considering those distances.","title":"Group Assignment"},{"location":"6Group/#group-assignment","text":"Test the design rules for your 3D printer(s) Document your work and explain what are the limits of your printer(s) (in a group or individually).","title":"Group Assignment"},{"location":"6Group/#3d-printing","text":"3D printing is a process of fabricating a three dimensional objects through a 3D digital model created in a Computer-Aided Design software (CAD).
